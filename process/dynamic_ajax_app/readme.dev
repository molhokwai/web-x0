question:
	- is there any eclipse plug in as simple to use as this file for the same purpose?

environnement and locations:
	- test files: tests_hmi.html
	- related files: tests_textcommand.html

definitions:
	- validation : complete functionality testing, from end user point-of-view
	- test : atomic unit-testing like validation

development cycle:
	passed validation:
		- manage.process : entitymanager.create
		- manage.process : querymanager.read
							limitations in nesting possibilities (see .update below)?
		- manage.process : entitymanager.update
							works but with limitations in nesting possibilities
							and operators usage (analysis of Gql restrictions necessary)
		- manage.process : entitymanager.delete
							limitations in nesting possibilities (see .update above)?
